# hubot-clmonitor



### Running hubot-clmonitor Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start hubot-clmonitor locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    hubot-clmonitor>

Then you can interact with hubot-clmonitor by typing `hubot-clmonitor help`.

    hubot-clmonitor> hubot-clmonitor help
    hubot-clmonitor animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds [snip]
    hubot-clmonitor help - Displays all of the help commands that hubot-clmonitor knows about.
