# craigslistbot



### Running craigslistbot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start craigslistbot locally by running:
	For Linux
    % bin/hubot
	For Windows
	  .\bin\hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    craigslistbot>

Then you can interact with craigslistbot by typing `craigslistbot help`.

    craigslistbot> craigslistbot help
    craigslistbot animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds [snip]
    craigslistbot help - Displays all of the help commands that hubot-clmonitor knows about.
